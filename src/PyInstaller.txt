1. Python modules
PyInstaller runs in the context of the system python version.
QLTK installer includes python from ~/python
PyCharm runs with python from venv4
Before making a distribution package, make sure the module versions of these pythons match.
- delete c:\users\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\Python to remove all user installed modules
- open a command prompt as admin (this will make that pip installs modules in the system folders
- run 'python_upgrade.bat' to synchronize the python module versions
- run 'PyInstaller main.spec' to create the package
